Final thoughts: CCTC Security exam and course

CTF reliability issues with the core issue being change management of the ctf backend environment

Walkthrough vs. ctf vs exam. What’s in the walkthrough is less than 50% of the content that is in the CTF. 100% of the CTF challenges were in the exams.

CTF exams was well developed and fair in regards to the difficulty.

Learning curve varies drastically between people. The Distance Learning does not help those with certain learning styles.

Mentality of cyber learning needs to be frustrating with a lot of googling unfortunately with DL and only having three instructors for 40+ class size quality of instruction is lessen.

Class 20-001 \(25MAY20 -29MAY20\) AAR

## CCTC Training

## Post Exploitation, Linux Exploitation, Windows Exploitation

### Sustain:

* * Assigned groups in discord allowed us to find the solution to Privilege escalation challenges. A better understanding was met while being in groups
  * Keep up the difficulty level but we would like to see more lectures that correlate to the knowledge needed to complete the challenges. For example: how to use John the Ripper with a wordlist to crack hashes
  * Windows Exploitation: The instructor covered everything needed to complete the challenges

### Improve

* * Permissions were not taught at all during the OS section of CCTC, and were left until the 3rd to last day of CCTC security to be taught. This should be the first thing taught.
  * Linux Exploitation challenges: The setup of the challenges were incomplete and required additional IP’s that the instructors did not have. Better Lab change management/documentation needs to take place to prevent the loss of information.
  * The Instruction period of class needs to be field in with more Why and What. Most of the time the instruction consisted of “here is this and here is that…….best of luck” This may be the intent of the class to make it more difficult and to teach us how to privilege escalate by ourselves but the intent was never let known.
  * Would be nice to work off of a kali machine to get more of a real world feel

Class 20-001 \(18MAY20 -21MAY20\) AAR

## CCTC Training

## Reverse Engineering/Buffer Overflow

### Sustain

* * Use of Discord as a redundancy to BBB when the instructor wasn’t able to share his screen and start the lecture.

### Improve

* * The entirety of this module \(and most of security\) is self taught. There is no point in having a class for this if the instructors answer questions by saying “go google it”.
  * The demo for Exploit Development was poorly executed. The instructor encountered so many errors during the demonstration that many felt lost after the demonstration was completed. Confusion could have been mitigated if we were given a video with the demonstration executed correctly.
  * SSG Holman and Mr. Keebler tend to say, look it up yourself or it is in the notes as opposed to helping students gain in understanding. Further a large amount is assumed students already know which many do not which makes students end up teaching other students as opposed to teachers teaching.

Class 20-001 \(11MAY20 -15MAY20\) AAR

## CCTC Training

## Recon, XSS, SQL

### Sustain

* * We are provided a large amount of time to work on the actual challenges which is very helpful in gaining understanding.
  * Some of the challenges are quite difficult, this is very nice in ensuring that students have a firm understanding, but there are times when asking for assistance that the instructors are quite lost as well. This should not be the case.

### Improve

* * Instructor should take questions seriously and answer them instead of saying “look at your notes”
  * Instructor should take criticism/different approaches positively instead of acting like his way is the only way to accomplish something.
